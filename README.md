EFT Hideout and Trader Automation

This was created solely to buy valuble items from traders and resell them on the market. And automated hideout production while I was at work.
This effective made me over 300 million roubles in patch 0.11.

Since then they have changed how market listings work. You can only list found in raid. However with some tweaking you could get it to work just on your hideout.

Files are a mess and just simply downloading this and running it will not work. Images need to be placed in the root of your C drive.

This uses the following python modules; keyboard, pyautogui, cv2. 

Code is located in /tarkov.py

This also contains mag loading script however not sure if this is the one I had working or if its an older version. See /mag.py
